A demo Android App created as part of an MSc Course

### Overview

The app is aimed at Hikers and adventurers, and the concept behind it involves installing QR code 'Badges' on top of local mountains to encourage and reward those who climb them. These badges are then unlocked in the app, and can be shown off or shared, with the idea of claiming as many as possible.

### Features

The app has the following screens:

- A Home screen, with a customisable image, and a row of recently collected badges and currently tracked badges.
- A Scan screen, with a camera view to scan any QR codes to receive the badges.
- A Wallet screen, to view all possible badges, and track and search them.

The app also contains:

- Sharing intents, to share badge details via the default Android share sheet.
- A weather API call, to fetch weather data for the user's current location.
